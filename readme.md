# SCALA

An Android application for the online signal processing and classification of time-series data. 
It has been developed at the University of Oldenburg during my PhD. 

## Overview of data flow
SCALA receives and sends out data using the LabstreamingLayer (https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer).
A more detailed description of its workings and the setup will follow soon.


## Detailed description
Please refer to the publication for details of the usage and the setup required for an experiment: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2017/3072870/
If you have questions, please open an issue here on Github or drop me a mail.
