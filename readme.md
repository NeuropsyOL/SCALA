# SCALA

An Android application for the online signal processing and classification of time-series data. 
It has been developed at the University of Oldenburg during my PhD. 

## Overview of data flow
SCALA receives and sends out data using the LabstreamingLayer (https://github.com/labstreaminglayer).
A more detailed description of its workings and the setup will follow soon.

## Detailed description
